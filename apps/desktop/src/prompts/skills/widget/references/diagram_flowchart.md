#### Flowchart

For sequential processes, cause-and-effect, decision trees.

**Planning**: Size boxes to fit their text generously. At 14px sans-serif, each character is ~8px wide — a label like "Load Balancer" (13 chars) needs a rect at least 140px wide. When in doubt, make boxes wider and leave more space between them. Cramped diagrams are the most common failure mode.

**Special characters are wider**: Chemical formulas (C₆H₁₂O₆), math notation (∑, ∫, √), subscripts/superscripts via <tspan> with dy/baseline-shift, and Unicode symbols all render wider than plain Latin characters. For labels containing formulas or special notation, add 30-50% extra width to your estimate. When in doubt, make the box wider — overflow looks worse than extra padding.

**Spacing**: 60px minimum between boxes, 24px padding inside boxes, 12px between text and edges. Leave 10px gap between arrowheads and box edges. Two-line boxes (title + subtitle) need at least 56px height with 22px between the lines.

**Vertical text placement**: Every `<text>` inside a box needs `dominant-baseline="central"`, with y set to the _centre_ of the slot it sits in. Without it SVG treats y as the baseline, the glyph body sits ~4px higher than you intended, and the descenders land on the line below. Formula: for text centred in a rect at (x, y, w, h), use `<text x={x+w/2} y={y+h/2} text-anchor="middle" dominant-baseline="central">`. For a row inside a multi-row box, y is the centre of _that row_, not of the whole box.

**Layout**: Prefer single-direction flows (all top-down or all left-right). Keep diagrams simple — max 4-5 nodes per diagram. The widget is narrow (~680px) so complex layouts break.

**When the prompt itself is over budget**: if the user lists 6+ components ("draw me auth, products, orders, payments, gateway, queue"), don't draw all of them in one pass — you'll get overlapping boxes and arrows through text, every time. Decompose: (1) a stripped overview with the boxes only and at most one or two arrows showing the main flow — no fan-outs, no N-to-N meshes; (2) then one diagram per interesting sub-flow ("here's what happens when an order is placed", "here's the auth handshake"), each with 3-4 nodes and room to breathe. Count the nouns before you draw. The user asked for completeness — give it to them across several diagrams, not crammed into one.

**Cycles don't get drawn as rings.** If the last stage feeds back into the first (Krebs cycle, event loop, GC mark-and-sweep, TCP retransmit), your instinct is to place the stages around a circle. Don't. Every spacing rule in this spec is Cartesian — there is no collision check for "input box orbits outside stage box on a ring". You will get satellite boxes overlapping the stages they feed, labels sitting on the dashed circle, and tangential arrows that point nowhere. The ring is decoration; the loop is conveyed by the return arrow.

Build a stepper with `builtin__show_widget` using HTML in `widget_code`. One panel per stage, dots or pills showing position (● ○ ○), Next wraps from the last stage back to the first — that's the loop. Each panel owns its inputs and products: an event loop's pending callbacks live _inside_ the Poll panel, not floating next to a box on a ring. Nothing collides because nothing shares the canvas. Only fall back to a linear SVG (stages in a row, curved `<path>` return arrow) when there's one input and one output total and no per-stage detail to show.

**Feedback loops in linear flows:** Don't draw a physical arrow traversing the layout (it fights the flow direction and clips edges). Instead:

- Small `↻` glyph + text near the cycle point: `<text>↻ returns to start</text>`
- Or restructure the whole diagram as a circle if the cycle IS the point

**Arrows:** A line from A to B must not cross any other box or label. If the direct path crosses something, route around with an L-bend: `<path d="M x1 y1 L x1 ymid L x2 ymid L x2 y2"/>`. Place arrow labels in clear space, not on the midpoint.

Keep all nodes the same height when they have the same content type (e.g. all single-line boxes = 44px, all two-line boxes = 56px).

**Flowchart components** — use these patterns consistently:

_Single-line node_ (44px tall): title only. The `c-blue` class sets fill, stroke, and text colors for both light and dark mode automatically — no `<style>` block needed.

```svg
<g class="node c-blue" data-send-prompt="Tell me more about T-cells">
  <rect x="100" y="20" width="180" height="44" rx="8" stroke-width="0.5"/>
  <text class="th" x="190" y="42" text-anchor="middle" dominant-baseline="central">T-cells</text>
</g>
```

_Two-line node_ (56px tall): bold title + muted subtitle.

```svg
<g class="node c-blue" data-send-prompt="Tell me more about dendritic cells">
  <rect x="100" y="20" width="200" height="56" rx="8" stroke-width="0.5"/>
  <text class="th" x="200" y="38" text-anchor="middle" dominant-baseline="central">Dendritic cells</text>
  <text class="ts" x="200" y="56" text-anchor="middle" dominant-baseline="central">Detect foreign antigens</text>
</g>
```

_Connector_ (no label — meaning is clear from source + target):

```svg
<line x1="200" y1="76" x2="200" y2="120" class="arr" marker-end="url(#arrow)"/>
```

_Neutral node_ (gray, for start/end/generic steps): use `class="box"` for auto-themed fill/stroke, and default text classes.

Make all nodes clickable by default when they should ask TouchAI a follow-up question — use `<g class="node" data-send-prompt="...">`. The hover effect is built in.
